bigtext-for-elementor
====================
You can add some text in the text editor and each line will be the same size than the others, thanks to Bigtext.

Just as simple as that.

CHANGELOG
-----------

**2018-04-13:** Full compliance to the Elementor developper API; creation of the bigtext-for-elementor.pot (in /languages) to ensure it can be translated easily; added some controls.

**2017-11-07:** First release.
